# Version 1.0.1
- Fixed the Marketplace page not showing the example GIF. No plugin changes.
# Version 1.0.2
- Actually fixed the Marketplace page not showing the example GIF (version 1.0.1 didn't work). Still no plugin changes.
# Version 1.0.3 (Major Update)
- Added WaveSchedules for 1 and 2 wave missions (ws1 and ws2) **(idea credit: Braindawg)**
- Fixed a comment on WaitForAllSpawned and WaitForAllDead KeyValues saying you could only have one or the other, which wasn't true **(bug found by: randomguy3016)**
- Added a description to the IsEndless KeyValue **(idea credit: fellen)**
- Fixed the Tank WaveSpawn (wspt) default name being tank01, instead of tankboss, which is what most maps use **(bug found by: randomguy30156)**
- Added an InitWaveOutput snippet **(bug found by: fellen)**
- Cleaned up the snippets a bit
- Put some KeyValues under an "Optional KeyValues" comment so people know they are optional
# Version 1.1.0 (The return of the snippets)
- Added a notice to README that this is open-source and can be used how you see fit, but giving credit is appreciated.
- Added the most annoying watermark in the world at the top of every WaveSchedule template (you're so welcome)
- Added WaveScedules for 9 and 10 wave missions (if you're using these you are a PSYCHOPATH).
- Added more description to most KeyValues, describing what they do in more detail.
- For the KeyValues in the WaveSpawns, the descriptions are only there for the first WaveSpawn, so it isn't as cluttered.
- Fixed ws7 not having a CanBotsAttackInSpawnRoom KeyValue.
- ACTUALLY fixed WaitForAllSpawned/Dead comments (they were still lurking in the shadows)
- Added WaveSpawn snippets for each class with some KeyValues already filled out.
