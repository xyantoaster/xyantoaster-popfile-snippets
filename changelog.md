- Added WaveSchedules for 1 and 2 wave missions (ws1 and ws2) **(idea credit: Braindawg)**

- Added a description to the IsEndless KeyValue **(idea credit: fellen)**
- Fixed the Tank WaveSpawn (wspt) default name being tank01, instead of tankboss, which is what most maps use **(bug found by: randomguy30156)**
- Added an InitWaveOutput snippet **(bug found by: fellen)**
- Cleaned up the snippets a bit
- Put some KeyValues under an "Optional KeyValues" comment so people know they are optional
