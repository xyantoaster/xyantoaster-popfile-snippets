## MvM Popfile Snippets
This is a Popfile snippets plugin for VSCode made to help speed up the creation of popfiles for MvM.

I am open to pull requests if you have something to change or add.

This has mostly everything you'll need to create a popfile quickly, so you can spend less time typing and more time testing your mission!

If you have any ideas for snippets that should be added, put them in the "issues" section on the GitHub page (make sure to tag it as an enhancement, though.)
